1) Selection of motors
   1) To find which motors to use, we do the initial sizing of the airship to estimate the drag required for the airship using empirical relations. 
   1) We find the motor and propeller combination, which provides the required thrust accordingly and replaces the weight of components instead of empirical relations with actual values found. 
   1) Repeat a and b till a suitable combination is found. Then, we also do the CFD analysis to confirm the thrust values. 
   1) These motors are used in the final airship.
1) Selection of Battery
   1) Once we find the motor and propeller combination, we also find the current requirement of the system using the motor specification sheet. 
   1) We find the battery capacity according to the current requirement and flight time. 
   1) We find the C rating according to the max current provided and battery capacity, as the max current is a function of these two. 
   1) We find the battery close to the given parameters and add the weight data into the sizing loop. 
1) Selection of control of RC
   1) If we control via an RC, a standard transmitter and receiver setup is used whose weight data is already available.
